# 📖 About The Project

This project is a **Modern Full Stack Real-Time Chat Application** developed using the **MERN Stack**. It enables users to securely authenticate, communicate in real time, upload media, and experience a modern responsive chat interface.

The application follows modern backend architecture by integrating **Clerk Authentication**, **MongoDB Atlas**, **Socket.IO**, **Docker**, **ImageKit**, and **Render Deployment**.

Rather than focusing only on building features, this project helped me understand how real-world applications are structured, debugged, and deployed.

# 🐛 Challenges Faced

During the development of this project, I encountered several real-world challenges that helped me improve my debugging and problem-solving skills.

### Challenges Solved

- ✅ Dockerfile not detected by Render (`DockerFile` vs `Dockerfile`)
- ✅ Linux and Windows command compatibility (`rm -rf` issue)
- ✅ Docker multi-stage build configuration
- ✅ Clerk Webhook verification failures
- ✅ MongoDB Atlas connection issues
- ✅ User synchronization between Clerk and MongoDB
- ✅ ImageKit media upload configuration
- ✅ Environment variable configuration in production
- ✅ Render deployment debugging
- ✅ Production vs Development environment differences

---

# 🧠 Debugging Journey

This project was more than just building features—it was about learning how to debug real-world production issues.

Some examples include:

- Debugging Docker build failures
- Fixing webhook signature verification
- Understanding Linux vs Windows command differences
- Configuring Render deployments
- Managing environment variables securely
- Fixing MongoDB schema mismatches
- Deploying a full-stack MERN application using Docker

These experiences significantly improved my backend development and deployment skills.
